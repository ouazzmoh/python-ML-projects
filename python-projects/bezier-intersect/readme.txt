This script detects the intersection of two Bezier curves.
The script takes mouse input to create the curves and shows approximations of the intersection.
The blue and red cross are precise approximations using the Newton Raphson method.
To run the script: python BezierIntersect.py
Decomment the lines 259, 261, 263, 265 to see the rectangles that bound the curves and converge to the intersection.
